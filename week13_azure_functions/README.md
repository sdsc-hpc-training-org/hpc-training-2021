# SDSC HPC User Training: Spring 2021

###  WEEK 13: 4/30/2021	

## TOPIC: Azure Functions for Scientists and Students	

**Presented By:** 
* [Rob Fatland (Univ. of Washington)](https://escience.washington.edu/people/rob-fatland/) ( rob5 at uw.edu )
* [Naomi Alterman](https://escience.washington.edu/people/naomi-alterman/) ( naomila at uw.edu )

Cloud computing is "someone else's computer" for a fee; but there is actually a surprising amount of complexity
and convenience involved, beyond the basics of computer power, storage and networking. This presentation will
cover a form of computing called ***serverless*** and will include real implementation on the Azure cloud
by means of *Azure Functions*. 

Some of this presentation will be given in "code along" format; so you may need to activate your Azure 
subscription and test logging in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in advance. You may also of
course simply audit the process as we go through it.
