## WEEK 6 TASKS:

### Task 1: 
Compile and run the examples in the ```hello-mpi``` directory.
Notice what happens if you ask for more cores or nodes.

### Task 2:
Compile and run the examples in the ```pi-mpi``` directory.
What changes can be made to the code or batch script to improve accuracy?

### Task 3: 
Compile and run the examples in the ```collectives``` directory.
Observe what happens when you change the number of nodes/cores in the batch script.

### Note: Reporting your work:
We will track your work using automated scripts
You will need to name the directories and permissions as described in the ``reporting_your_work.md`` document.
