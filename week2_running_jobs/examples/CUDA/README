Directory content as explained below.
For exercises see subdirectories exercise/, which contain CUDA
code that needs either fixing or improving. See comment in the
source code.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

./hello_world/

hello_world_cpu.c
Standard C "Hello World" program
Can be compiled with standard C compiler or NVIDIA nvcc CUDA compiler

hello_world_cpu2.cu
Identical to the standard C "Hello World" program
Can be compiled with nvcc

hello_world_device.cu
Contains a GPU kernel that will be executed on the GPU
(though the kernel does nothing)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

./addition/

add_gpu.cu
CUDA program that adds two integer numbers on the GPU

vector_add_cpu.c
C program for simple vector addition on the CPU

vector_add_gpu.cu
CUDA program for simple vector addition on the GPU
Launches all kernels at once

vector_add_gpu2.cu
Same as above but launches fixed number of kernels

------------------------------------------------------------------------

./square_array/

square_array.cu
CUDA program to square matrix elements of an arbitrary size matrix 
in parallel on the GPU. Uses two-dimensional grids/blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

./1d_stencil/

1d_stencil.cu
CUDA program that performs 1D stencil operation in parallel on the GPU
for an arbitrary sized vector. Boundary halos are set to zero. This could be
changed for example to periodic boundary conditions.
Uses shared memory to optimize performance as well as thread synchronization
within blocks.
