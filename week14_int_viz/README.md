# SDSC HPC User Training: Spring 2021

###  WEEK 14: 5/7/2021	

## TOPIC:   Interactive Visualization on HPC Systems Using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, and Bokeh	

**Presented By:** [Jeff Sale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-sale-26961a7/) 

** Description:** 
Python is rapidly becoming the programming language of choice for scientific research, and Jupyter Notebooks 
provide a user-friendly way of writing and running python code and of teaching and learning how to program. 
Visual analytics is playing an increasingly important role in data science by allowing researchers to explore 
massive amounts of data for patterns which may not be obvious using other methods.

In this lesson, we will briefly review data visualization principles and practices and jump into a series of 
data visualization examples using Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, bokeh, seaborn, and networkx.
